## About The Project

Big Three is a blog project developed for a college assignment. The idea was to create a blog that presented the group as a software developing company, with sections for the blog posts, the tech stack, previous projects and about the group.

As it is a static website, the technology of choice was Gatsby. There is a connection with **Contentful**, where all the posts are made, and also with **Disqus**, to provide comment sections on the posts.

The website was deployed on **Netlify**.

The design was created on **Adobe XD**.
